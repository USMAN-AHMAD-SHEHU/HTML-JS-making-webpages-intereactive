        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>

        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
                ohnoesSays.innerHTML = "I'm practicing for my future career as a <strong>professional frowner</strong>. It's a booming industry, you know. <em>LOL.</em>";

            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
                winstonSays.textContent = "Oh, you know, He is just trying to corner the market on the world's most sought-after skill, professional frowning. who wouldn't want a gloomy guru in their office?. hahaha.";
